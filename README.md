# Lumberjack - ðŸ‘“ log viewer for Application Insights

Lumberjack is an open source log viewer for reading exceptions and traces written to [Microsoft Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-insights/).

The app gives you a graphical interface to view, navigate and query your logs.

It will give you an overview of your logs with a chart that shows you amount of traces vs errors & warnings. ![Chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/357283/42462304-2b79834e-83a3-11e8-98fe-0abbcadb35ef.png).

## Features

* Fast Querying - Lumberjack runs the queries on your Microsoft Application Insights over rest.
* Fast rendering - We use backgroundworkers to parse the query result and to make sure the UI allows smooth scrolling through thousands of rows.
* Graph overview so you can easily spot outliers and context.
* Support for hashtags - if your trace message contains `#something` you can click and immediately search for the hasthag.
* Select & grep - Select any text and hit `ctrl+enter` to grep for that text.
* Search/filter property - Filter for any property, e.g. `client_City:Dublin`.
* Exclude filter - use `-` to exclude logs from your search, e.g. `-client_City:Dublin`.
* Auto refresh mode - Automatically refresh the logs every 60 seconds, perfect for dashboard screens.
* Clickable OperationID - to quickly view related logs and errors.
* Supports multiple App insights apps
